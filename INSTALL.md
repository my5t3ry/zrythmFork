# Dependencies
- Suil with GTK3 support is needed. Some distros don't have the latest versions so might have to manually install (tip: use suil-git on arch linux)
- Other dependencies should show up when `configure` is run if they are missing. Install using the distro's package manager

# Compile
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```
This will generate build/debug/zrythm or build/release/zrythm

# Run
```
build/debug/zrythm

# Install
```
sudo make install
```
