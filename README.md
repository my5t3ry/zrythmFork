# THIS REPOSITORY HAS MOVED TO https://git.zrythm.org/zrythm/zrythm

Zrythm is a free modern music production system for GNU/Linux focused on electronic music.

It is written in C and it uses the GTK+3 toolkit. Bits and pieces are taken from other programs like Ardour and Jalv.

## Using
At the moment, Zrythm assumes you have Jack installed and will only run if Jack is running. For Jack setup instructions see https://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack

Everything else should be self-explanatory. Manual coming soon.
